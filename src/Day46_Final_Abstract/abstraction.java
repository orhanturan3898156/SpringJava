/*
  abstraction: hiding implementation details.
  concentrating on essentials, without worrying about the details.

  abstract method: a method without body/implementation
                   a method that's meant to be overridden

                   public abstract void method();



Ex1:
  Car:
     start();

  BMW:
     start(): push start button
  Toyota:
      start():Insert Key

Ex2:
Shape:
   Area();

Triangle:
     Area():
Circle:
     Area():
Square:
     Area():

---------------------------------------------------
two ways to achieving abstraction:

1. abstract class: a class that's meant to be inherited.
When used final keyword,we cannot use ABSTRACT. Because to be able to use Abstract we have to override.
However ,if it is final, we cannot use abstract
     *** abstract class cannot be/contain final,static and private.

     ***abstract class cannot be





2. Interface
