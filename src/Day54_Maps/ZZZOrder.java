    MAPS
    -Only takes objects and size is dynamic.
    -Difference with Collection and Maps:
      -Map is collection of Pair.
      -If you want to store employee's name and salary with String and double, normally we cannot store in the same variable.
      List<String> name=new ArrayList<>();
      List<Double> salary=new ArrayList<>();

     ***  MAP:You can store different types of data in the same place.
     Map<String, Double>
          Key, Value >>> they must be object.
     Map Interface:they must be object.

     Map<String, Double> employeeInfo=new LinkedHashMap<>();
     Then, we use  put(key, value). method to add those data.

     Map doesn't have index number. we should give the key to retrive the data.
     --get(Key)--> to retrive any value.
     --remove(Key) --> to remove any object

     NOTE: map doesn't accept duplicate Key value.
