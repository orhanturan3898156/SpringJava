    Iterable(I):
    It is the root interface of Collection.
    We need it,because we use it when iterate the objects.
    Classes that implements iterable, gains the ability to iterate the objects.
    we can apply Iterator(I) to the classes that are implementing Iterable.

    Iterator(I): reason we need;
     1_ allow us to get access to each objects of the collections type.
     2_ allow us the remove the object itself.

     Iterator():iterates any given collection,then returns Iterator(I)
     hashNext():checks if there is enough elements that can be iterated. returns boolean.
     Next(): get the object if hasNext() condition is true.
     remove(): removes the current
