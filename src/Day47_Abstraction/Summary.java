    abstraction:hiding the implementation details.means you don't provide the body.
    Only Abstract method is the method doesn't have body in Java.
    A method that's meant to be overridden. That means we need to inherit it first.

    Main difference between Abstraction and Inheritance is:
       -Inheritance >> we provide the implementation
       -Abstraction >> we hide the implementation

    ***if the implementation is same but tha wayw we create is different we use abstraction.
    That's why we ignore the body.







    regular way:
    public void methodName(){
        body~statement
    }

    Abstraction:
    public abstract void method()
